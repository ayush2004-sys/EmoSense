EmoSense is a smart emotion recognition system that integrates both text-based sentiment analysis and
facial expression recognition to classify human emotions using AI. Designed with a user-friendly Streamlit
interface, the system leverages deep learning models trained on datasets like FER-2013 and labeled text
corpora to detect emotions in real time from either typed messages or uploaded images.
The system loads pre-trained .h5 models for quick and accurate predictions, utilizing tokenization and label
encoding for efficient input preprocessing. The modular design supports future expansion into voice or
video modalities and can be used in fields like mental health, customer feedback analysis, and social
robotics.
